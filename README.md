# Schedule-Smart
An automated timetable generator

The automated timetable generator project aims to provide an efficient and effective solution for developing and managing timetables. This project intends to ease the process of creating a timetable and reduce the amount of manual work required. The application accepts information in the form of class schedules, teacher schedules, classroom capacities, time duration, and the number of days courses are held. Based on this information, the software develops a timetable while taking into account different constraints such as avoiding scheduling conflicts, maximizing classroom use, and ensuring that each class is assigned to an appropriate teacher
